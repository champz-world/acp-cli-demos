# ACP CLI Demos

This repo collects demos and reusable agent skills that show how agents can use [`acp-cli`](https://github.com/Virtual-Protocol/acp-cli) for real-world commerce workflows.

The first demo shows an ACP agent subscribing to a paid Substack using:

- ACP Agent Email for signup, receipts, OTPs, and account verification
- ACP Agent Card for bounded, single-use checkout payments
- `acp-cli` for identity, email, card issuance, payment status, 3DS, and receipt checks
- Browser automation for the merchant checkout page

## Demos

### Paid Substack Subscription

Path: [`demos/paid-substack-subscription`](demos/paid-substack-subscription)

This demo validates that an ACP agent can complete a paid newsletter checkout end-to-end, then verify the captured charge, receipt, and paid content access.

## Use The Skill

### ACP Paid Subscription Checkout

Path: [`skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout`](skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout)

This is the reusable skill behind the Substack demo. It is intentionally broader than Substack: it describes a bounded paid subscription checkout workflow using ACP identity, email, and card primitives.

The recommended flow is to install the skill, then give the agent only the merchant-specific details: target subscription, plan, billing cadence, spend cap, and verification requirement. You should not need to paste the full long-form prompt for each run.

Install for Codex:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout ~/.codex/skills/
```

Install for Claude Code:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R skills/acp-paid-subscription-checkout ~/.claude/skills/
```

Invoke in Codex:

```text
Use $acp-paid-subscription-checkout to complete a bounded paid subscription checkout for my ACP agent and verify access.
```

Invoke in Claude Code:

```text
/acp-paid-subscription-checkout Subscribe my ACP agent email to the requested paid plan and verify access.
```

Other agents can read the same `SKILL.md` and `references/` files directly, or use the demo prompt as a raw fallback.

## Safety Model

These demos can involve live payments. A checkout agent should only issue cards and click final paid checkout buttons when the user has explicitly authorized:

- merchant
- plan
- billing cadence
- maximum amount
- ACP agent email
- ACP agent card payment method

The agent must stop before paying if checkout details differ from the authorization.

Final outputs must redact full card numbers, CVVs, magic links, OTPs, and other sensitive payment details.
